//Ancestral Stories:** In many African cultures, the art of storytelling is passed
//down from generation to generation. Imagine you're creating an application that
//records these oral stories and translates them into different languages. The
//stories vary by length, moral lessons, and the age group they are intended for.
//Think about how you would model `Story`, `StoryTeller`, and `Translator`
//objects, and how inheritance might come into play if there are different types of
//stories or storytellers.
